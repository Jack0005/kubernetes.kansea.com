### 摘要


Deprecated: Gracefully shut down a resource by name or filename.

The stop command is deprecated, all its functionalities are covered by delete command.
See 'kubectl delete --help' for more details.

Attempts to shut down and delete a resource that supports graceful termination.
If the resource is scalable it will be scaled to 0 before deletion.

```
kubectl stop (-f FILENAME | TYPE (NAME | -l label | --all))
```

### 示例

```
# Shut down foo.
$ kubectl stop replicationcontroller foo

# Stop pods and services with label name=myLabel.
$ kubectl stop pods,services -l name=myLabel

# Shut down the service defined in service.json
$ kubectl stop -f service.json

# Shut down all resources in the path/to/resources directory
$ kubectl stop -f path/to/resources
```

### 选项

```
      --all[=false]: [-all] to select all the specified resources.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to file of resource(s) to be stopped.
      --grace-period=-1: Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative.
      --ignore-not-found[=false]: Treat "resource not found" as a successful stop.
  -o, --output="": Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
  -l, --selector="": Selector (label query) to filter on.
      --timeout=0: The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
